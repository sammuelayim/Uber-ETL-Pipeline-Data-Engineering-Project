## üìú Project Overview  
This project showcases a complete **end-to-end data engineering pipeline** for analyzing Uber trip data. By leveraging **modern data engineering tools and cloud technologies**, the pipeline handles data ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization. This is a comprehensive demonstration of transforming raw data into actionable insights!  

---

### Key Features:  
- **ETL Pipeline**: Developed using [Mage](https://www.mage.ai/) for seamless data ingestion and transformation.  
- **BigQuery Analytics**: Leveraged Google BigQuery for large-scale data storage and analysis.  
- **Looker Studio Dashboard**: Created interactive and insightful dashboards for effective visualization.

## üöÄ Project Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Ingestion**  
- Import raw Uber trip data into Mage pipelines for preprocessing.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Transformation**  
- Cleaned and normalized data.  
- Created dimensional tables such as `datetime_dim`, `rate_code_dim`, and `pickup_location_dim`.  
- Built a consolidated `fact_table` for analytics.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Export**  
- Uploaded transformed data to Google BigQuery for querying and analysis.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Visualization**  
- Designed a **Looker Studio dashboard** featuring:  
  - Filters for Vendor, Payment Type, Rate Code, and Trip Distance.  
  - Revenue metrics, average trip distance, and fare amount.  
  - Interactive maps for pickup and drop-off locations.
